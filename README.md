# Stock AI Agent

An automated portfolio risk and factor analysis system. A single unified pipeline fetches live broker holdings, runs Fama-French 5-factor regressions on every watchlist stock, computes a full risk dashboard, and delivers a bilingual (English + Chinese) HTML email report after each US market close.

All trading decisions remain manual. The system exists to give you clean, quantitative input for those decisions.

## Known Limitations

### Backtest Survivorship Bias

The walk-forward backtest (`RUN_MODE=backtest`) fetches the **current** S&P 500 constituent list from Wikipedia. Companies removed through bankruptcy, forced acquisition, or index ejection are **never included** in the historical universe. This overstates out-of-sample Sharpe ratios and understates drawdowns. Treat figures as **upper-bound estimates**.

Eliminating the bias requires a point-in-time constituent database (CRSP, Compustat, EODHD). Every backtest result is flagged `[!] SURVIVORSHIP BIAS`.

### VaR Model Risk: Normal Distribution Assumption

Plain EWMA VaR (`var_95_ewma`) underestimates tail losses by 15–30% in stress regimes because equity returns are negatively skewed and fat-tailed. Three estimates are always computed side-by-side:

| Metric | Method | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `var_95_ewma` / `var_99_ewma` | Normal EWMA | Reference — underestimates in stress |
| `var_95_cf` / `var_99_cf` | **Cornish-Fisher** — adjusts for empirical skewness and excess kurtosis | **Primary alert trigger and report display** |
| `var_99_evt` | **EVT / Generalized Pareto** (peaks-over-threshold) | Most reliable for extreme quantiles; falls back to historical if < 20 exceedances |

For 21-day horizon tail risk the Monte Carlo DCC-GARCH + Hawkes simulation provides the most comprehensive fat-tail coverage.

## FF5 Factor Model

### Per-Stock Regression

`run_factor_regression()` solves via OLS:

```
Rᵢ − RF = α + β_MKT·(Mkt-RF) + β_SMB·SMB + β_HML·HML + β_RMW·RMW + β_CMA·CMA + ε
```

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| `alpha_ann` | Annualised intercept α = α_daily × 252 |
| `t_alpha` | OLS t-statistic of α; t > 1.5 → BUY, t < −1.5 → SELL |
| `ir` | Information Ratio = (α_daily / σ_residuals) × √252 |
| `r_squared` | Model fit quality |
| `beta_mkt/smb/hml/rmw/cma` | Factor loadings |
| `signal` | BUY / SELL / HOLD — driven by statistical significance of α |

**Window:** last 252 aligned trading days (falls back to available if < 252 but ≥ 63; skips ticker entirely if < 63).

The stock factor table is **sorted by IR** — stocks with the highest risk-adjusted excess return appear first.

### Portfolio Factor Exposure

`portfolio_factor_exposure()` computes market-value-weighted averages of each beta and α across equity holdings. Shown in the report as a single aggregate row: useful for detecting unintended style tilts (e.g., unintended growth/value bet, concentration in small-caps).

### Performance Attribution

`compute_attribution()` decomposes the realized equity portfolio return over the **last 21 trading days** into:

```
R_portfolio = RF + β_MKT·(Mkt-RF) + β_SMB·SMB + β_HML·HML + β_RMW·RMW + β_CMA·CMA + α_residual
```

| Row | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Each factor row | β × realized factor return over the period |
| Factor total | Sum of all factor contributions + RF |
| **Alpha (stock picking)** | Actual return − factor total — tells you whether your holdings outperformed their factor model |

Large positive α: stock selection added value beyond what the factor tilts explain.  
Large negative α: you're being compensated only for beta exposure, not for selection.

### Robust Signal (PSR + Deflated IR + OOS)

`compute_robust_signal()` applies three additional filters on top of the naive t(α) signal to reduce false discoveries:

| Filter | What it measures | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| **PSR** (Probabilistic Sharpe Ratio) | P(true IR > 0) corrected for non-normality (skewness, kurtosis) | PSR > 85% → BUY |
| **Deflated IR** | IR adjusted for multiple-testing across M strategies (Bailey–Lopez de Prado 2014) | IR_deflated > 0 |
| **Multi-window consistency** | α positive across 63/126/252-day windows simultaneously | ≥ 2/3 windows positive |
| **OOS hit rate** | Rolling 126-day train / 21-day test — fraction of periods where sign(α) = sign(realized excess return) | > 55% |

A BUY `robust_signal` requires all four filters to pass. The naive t(α) signal is shown in brackets in the report if it differs.

### Factor Collinearity Diagnostics

`check_factor_collinearity()` runs every cycle in `RUN_MODE=full` to detect problematic linear dependencies among the FF5 factors (typically HML↔CMA and Mkt-RF↔RMW):

| Diagnostic | Warning threshold |
|---|---|
| VIF per factor | > 5 concerning, > 10 severe |
| Correlation matrix condition number | > 10 |
| Pairwise |r| > 0.4 pairs | Any detected |

Collinearity does not invalidate betas but inflates their standard errors — signals should be weighted less heavily when VIFs are elevated.

### Cross-Sectional IC Analysis

`compute_universe_ic()` measures whether the alpha signal has genuine cross-sectional predictive power, not just in-sample fit:

1. At each of 8 evaluation points, estimate alpha for every watchlist stock using the prior 126 trading days of data
2. Rank stocks by estimated alpha
3. Observe actual 21-day forward excess returns and rank those
4. IC = Spearman rank correlation between predicted and realised ranks

| Output | Interpretation |
|---|---|
| `ic_mean` | Average signal quality; IC > 0.05 is meaningful for daily equity data |
| `ic_ir` | IC divided by IC volatility, annualised — analogous to Sharpe of the signal |
| `pvalue` | Two-tailed p-value (normal approximation); < 0.05 → statistically significant |

IC < 0 (signal predicts wrong direction) or p > 0.10 (noise) are warnings that the FF5 alpha ranking should be used with caution.

### Signal-Weighted Allocation

`compute_signal_weights()` translates robust BUY signals into a model portfolio:

```
Score = PSR × IR_deflated × (1 + 0.2 × alpha_consistency / n_windows)
Weight = Score / ΣScores   (before capping)
```

- Each position capped at **20%**; excess redistributed to uncapped positions iteratively
- Portfolio-level FF5 factor exposures are computed as Σ(weight × beta_factor)
- Exposures exceeding **1.5×** trigger a warning in the report

The signal portfolio is shown in the email report with per-position PSR, IR, and consistency, plus the portfolio-level factor exposure summary.

### Decision Trace

`enrich_suggestions()` attaches a concise reason to every rebalancing suggestion, cross-referencing the FF5 regression:

- `α=+8.2% t=+2.3 → BUY signal; underweight` — optimizer is increasing weight of a statistically significant outperformer
- `α=−3.8% t=−1.8 → SELL signal; overweight` — optimizer is trimming an underperformer
- `α=+1.4% t=+0.9; trim to reduce concentration` — neutral alpha, purely a concentration reduction

This lets you evaluate each manual trade decision in terms of the underlying factor signal, not just the weight delta.

### VaR Methodology

| Key | Formula | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `var_95_ewma` | `−μ + 1.645 · σ_EWMA` | Normal; underestimates fat tails — reference only |
| `var_95_cf` | `−μ − z_cf · σ_EWMA` where `z_cf = z + (z²−1)S/6 + (z³−3z)K/24 − (2z³−5z)S²/36` | Cornish-Fisher; **primary alert trigger** |
| `var_99_evt` | GPD fit to worst-10% losses via `scipy.stats.genpareto` | EVT peaks-over-threshold; most reliable at 99%+ |

### Monte Carlo (21-day horizon)

`run_mc_portfolio()` runs 50 000 DCC-GARCH + Hawkes paths:

| Output | Description |
|---|---|
| VaR 95% / 99% | Empirical percentile of terminal P&L distribution |
| CVaR 95% | Mean loss in worst 5% of paths |
| Max drawdown (mean / p95) | Peak-to-trough along each path |
| P(loss > 10%) / P(loss > 20%) | Loss-probability ladder |
| Margin call probability | IBKR RegT breach on any day |
| Sharpe / Sortino / Calmar | Median across paths |
| Trading costs | Commission + half-spread + √ market-impact |
| CGT (median) | Irish CGT 33% on realised gains > €1 270 |

Configured in `config/settings.yaml` under `monte_carlo:`.

## Markowitz Optimisation

### Efficient Frontier

`compute_frontier()` samples 1 200 random Dirichlet portfolios, then solves for the max-Sharpe portfolio via SLSQP. Expected returns come from FF5-implied μ using the same in-sample window (no look-ahead). The chart is a matplotlib PNG embedded inline (CID) in the email.

### Rebalancing Suggestions (3-tier)

| Tier | Condition | Label |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Act | \|Δweight\| ≥ 5%, no Irish CGT obstacle | Red — immediate action |
| 2 — Watch | 2–5% delta, or reducing a winner (CGT 33% applies) | Amber — monitor |
| 3 — Hold | \|Δweight\| < 2% | Grey — trade cost exceeds benefit |

Each suggestion includes an α-based **decision trace** explaining the underlying factor signal.

### Diversification Candidates (Bonds & Gold)

`marginal_impact()` evaluates each bond/gold entry from the watchlist: ΔSharpe, ΔVol, correlation to current equity portfolio, suggested weight, and FX rate note.

Current candidates in `config/watchlist.csv`: TLT, IEF, AGG (Treasuries), GLD.

## Walk-Forward Backtest

`RUN_MODE=backtest` runs a rolling walk-forward validation:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Training window | 756 days (~3 yr) | Used to fit betas, covariance, and FF5 premiums |
| Test window | 63 days (~1 quarter) | Out-of-sample Sharpe, max drawdown, turnover |
| Min asset history | 252 days | Asset excluded from a window if data starts mid-window |

**Bias controls:** FF5 factor premiums restricted to training slice; assets must have data from the first 5 days of the training window; test gaps forward-filled then zero-filled.

**Output flags (always shown):**
- `[!] SURVIVORSHIP BIAS` — universe is current S&P 500 only
- `[OK] No look-ahead` — FF5 premiums restricted to training window

| Price staleness | Last close > 4 calendar days old → WARNING | `cleaner.py`, `price_loader.py` |
| Data gaps | > 10 missing trading days in window → WARNING | `cleaner.py` |
| Price spikes | Single-day move > 50% → WARNING | `cleaner.py` |
| FX staleness | FX rate > 4 days old → WARNING (still used) | `price_loader.py` |
| Cache staleness | Snapshot fallback > 2 days old → WARNING | `cache.py` |
| Corrupt cache | Invalid JSON silently skipped; next file tried | `cache.py` |
| Split/dividend adjustment | `auto_adjust=True` explicit on all yfinance calls | `price_loader.py`, `fetcher.py`, `spy_universe.py` |

## Watchlist

`config/watchlist.csv` — edit and commit; changes take effect on next run.

```csv
ticker,weight,notes,asset_class,currency
AAPL,1.0,Apple Inc,equity,USD
MSFT,1.0,Microsoft Corp,equity,USD
NVDA,1.0,NVIDIA Corp,equity,USD
TLT,1.0,iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF,bond,USD
GLD,1.0,SPDR Gold Shares,gold,USD
```

- `asset_class=equity` rows are included in the FF5 factor ranking
- `asset_class=bond` and `gold` rows are evaluated as diversification candidates
- `notes` becomes the display name in the candidates table

## Configuration

### `config/settings.yaml`

```yaml
limits:
  history_days: 730

factor_model:
  window_days: 252        # OLS regression window; falls back if fewer days available
  min_window_days: 63     # skip ticker if aligned days < this

monte_carlo:
  n_paths:  50000
  horizon:  21
  model:    hawkes   # hawkes | garch | gbm
```

### `config/thresholds.yaml`

Per-metric alert thresholds, severity levels, and bilingual labels. All configurable without code changes.

### `config/volatility.yaml`

EWMA lambda (0.94), GARCH parameters, lookback windows, ECB risk-free rate (3.5%).

## Environment Variables

### Required

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SMTP_HOST` | Outbound mail server (e.g. `smtp.gmail.com`) |
| `SMTP_PORT` | Usually `587` |
| `SMTP_USER` | Sender email address |
| `SMTP_PASS` | Gmail app password or SMTP password |
| `REPORT_TO_EMAIL` | Portfolio report recipient |
| `RECIPIENT_EMAIL` | Additional recipient |

### Recommended

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | SendGrid fallback if SMTP fails |
| `ALPHA_VANTAGE_KEY` | Optional price data enrichment |

### Broker APIs (at least one needed for live portfolio)

| Variable | Platform |
|---|---|
| `IBKR_FLEX_TOKEN` + `IBKR_QUERY_ID` | Interactive Brokers Flex Query |
| `T212_API_KEY` + `T212_API_SECRET` | Trading 212 REST API |
| `ETORO_API_KEY` | eToro (mock/CSV if absent) |

If all broker APIs fail the pipeline falls back to the most recent local snapshot in `cache/`.

## Quick Start (local)

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in SMTP_*, REPORT_TO_EMAIL at minimum

# 3. Full pipeline after US market close
RUN_MODE=full python main.py

# 4. Portfolio risk only (skip watchlist factor ranking)
RUN_MODE=portfolio python main.py

# 5. Alert check only (no report)
RUN_MODE=alert_check python main.py

# 6. Walk-forward backtest
RUN_MODE=backtest python main.py

# 7. Local scheduler (full pipeline 21:30 UTC, alerts every 4h)
python scheduler.py
```

## GitHub Actions

### Workflows

| File | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `daily_run.yml` | Cron × 2/day + manual dispatch | Resolves `RUN_MODE` from UTC hour; runs `main.py`; sends bilingual report |
| `ci.yml` | Push/PR to main or master | Syntax-checks all Python files; import smoke test including factor model, attribution, decision trace, and report section assertions |

### Cron Schedule

| UTC time | Dublin (IST) | New York (ET) | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14:00 | 15:00 | 10:00 | `alert_check` |
| 21:30 | 22:30 | 17:30 | `full` |

### Setup

1. Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
2. Add each variable from the environment table as a repository secret
3. Push to `master` — CI runs automatically; daily analysis starts from the next scheduled cron

**Manual trigger:** Actions → Daily Stock & Portfolio Analysis → Run workflow → choose a run mode.
